# django-crud
## Lab 28

This is building off of both labs 26 and 27. We were working on the read view yesterday with both the list view and detail view. Now to round put the CRUD method we need views for Create, Update, and Delete
The Goal of today is to add 3 more views for adding data.
1) Create View:<br>
Allow the user to fill out a form and add that information to the model.
2) Update View: <br>
Allow the user to go in and update the information that they have stored
3) Delate View:<br>
Last allow the user to delete the posts that are saved to the database.
